      At the start of a new session, check for a session file for the current project:

      ```bash
      ls -t ~/.local/share/nix-agents/sessions/*/$(basename $PWD)/*.json 2>/dev/null | head -1 | xargs cat 2>/dev/null
      ```

      Use the session file to:
      - Understand what was accomplished previously
      - Continue incomplete work
      - Verify the current branch matches expectations

      If no session file exists, proceed normally — do not error or warn.
